# Disease Prediction Web App

A machine learning powered web application for disease prediction using user input data.  
The application uses a trained ML model and offers a user-friendly web interface built with Flask.

## 🚀 Features

- Predict disease based on user inputs.
- Interactive web interface (HTML + CSS).
- Machine Learning model integrated with Flask.
- Visualization and data analysis with Python.
- Easy deployment and extension.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- HTML / CSS (Jinja2 templates)
- Jupyter Notebook (for model training and experiments)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML_Disease_Prediction.git
cd ML_Disease_Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Running the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Then, open your browser and go to:
